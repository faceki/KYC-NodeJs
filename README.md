<h1>#Faceki Platform Node.js official SDK</h1>

Welcome to Faceki Official Node.js integrations instructions.

Node. js brings event-driven programming to web servers, enabling development of fast web servers in JavaScript. Developers can create scalable servers without using threading, by using a simplified model of event-driven programming that uses callbacks to signal the completion of a task.
